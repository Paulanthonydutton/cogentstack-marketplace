# CogentSpec Marketplace

This repository contains three separate Git marketplaces and release records:

- `.agents/plugins/` and `plugins/cogentstack/` distribute the thin CogentSpec Codex plugin.
- `.claude-plugin/` and `claude-plugins/cogentstack/` distribute the desktop-only CogentSpec plugin for Claude Code.
- `contracts/` publishes the open Community Guardrail Pack protocol and its Git-reviewed registry.

It also publishes the authoritative `desktop/marketplace.json` release record for CogentSpec Desktop. Windows installers are attached to versioned GitHub Releases rather than committed to Git history. The web installer reads this record, verifies the published SHA-256, and keeps Launch visibly disabled until the installed local runtime is detected. Windows always retains the user's approval before executing a first-time installer.

Community Guardrail Packs are declarative. They can define requirements, controls, guidance, and acceptance evidence, but they cannot execute scripts or contain CogentSpec's protected runtime rules. CogentSpec's proprietary engine remains responsible for compatibility review, binding, execution, entitlement, and release decisions.

## Validate the contract marketplace

```bash
node scripts/validate-contract-marketplace.mjs
node scripts/validate-desktop-marketplace.mjs
node scripts/validate-claude-marketplace.mjs
```

## Claude Code Desktop

The Claude plugin retains `$cogentstack` as the common invocation. It resolves the current Claude Code Desktop project's isolated logical CogentSpec context, starts or reuses the same background Desktop Bridge used by CogentSpec Web and Qwen Desktop, and returns the matching web URL. It does not open or inspect browser tabs, hide the Claude sidebar, resize windows, embed CogentSpec, or automate Claude's private interface.

Claude Web is intentionally outside this package. It may use a separate remote-connector flow later.

## ChatGPT and Codex Desktop

The Codex plugin is installed from the Git-backed `.agents/plugins/` marketplace and retains `$cogentstack` as the common invocation. It resolves the current AI Project's isolated logical CogentSpec context, starts or reuses one background Desktop Bridge for that context, and returns the matching CogentSpec Web URL. It does not open or select browser tabs, inspect browser profiles, hide sidebars, resize windows, or embed CogentSpec into every AI Project.

Desktop Bridge performs only explicitly approved local actions queued by CogentSpec Web: project creation, deletion, preview generation, and repository operations. Qwen Desktop is an optional separate application and reuses the same Bridge; it does not install a second copy. ChatGPT and Claude remain their official independent desktop applications.
